[h1]Calamity Schematic Exporter[/h1]

Calamity Schematic Exporter allows you to take screen selection captures and export them as schematics for consumption by Calamity's schematic manager.

This mod is useless to you unless you are developing Calamity or a Calamity add-on mod. Only Calamity's codebase can use files made in this schematic format.

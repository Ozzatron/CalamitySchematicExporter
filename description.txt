Calamity Schematic Exporter allows you to take screen selection captures and export them as schematics for consumption by Calamity's schematic manager.

Schematics can contain tiles and walls from any mod but do not save tile entities. Attempting to place a schematic which contains tiles or walls from an unloaded mod will place TML Unloaded Tiles and Walls, respectively.

This mod also adds a special tile and wall for use in schematics. The Schematic Preserver Tile/Wall will never be placed by the schematic manager and are used to mark positions where you would like the original tiles/walls to remain untouched. Leaving the original tile untouched will also preserve liquid, wires, sloping, etc.

Sprites for the Schematic Preserver Tile/Wall are taken from Example Mod. Mod icon provided by Heart Plus Up! and PokerFace.
